# Yahtzee Leaderboard
My wife and I play a lot of Yahtzee. For fun, I thought it would be fun to track our scores, put them into a database, and visualize some stats about our games.

Currently a work-in-progress. Trying out different views and calculations to look at.

## Current views
- Player summary (grand total, number of games played, number of wins)

## To Do
- Scorecard view
  - Most recent game
  - Average scorecard
  - All cards

- Highest individual values

- Possibly others
